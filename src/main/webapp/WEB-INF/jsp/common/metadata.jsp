	content="The Library and Archives of Canada Act received Royal Assent on April 22, 2004. For the purpose of
	preservation it allows library and Archives Canada (LAC) to collect a representative sample of Canadian websites.
	To meet its new mandate, LAC began to harvest the web domain of the Federal Government of Canada starting in
	December 2005. As resources permit, this harvesting activity will be undertaken on a semi-annual basis.
	The website data which is harvested is stored in the Government of Canada Web Archive (GC WA).
	Client access to the content of the GC WA is provided through searching by keyword, by department name, and by URL.
	It is also possible to search by specific format type, e.g. .pdf. At the time of its launch in Fall 2007, approximately 100 million digital objects
	(over 4 terabytes) of archived Federal Government website data was made accessible via the LAC website.">
